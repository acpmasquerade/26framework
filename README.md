26framework 
===========

Probably an ultra lightweight PHP framework

Yet another ?

Something which fits my taste :) . I hope it does fit yours too :P 

MVC ?

Do you seriously need that ? If yes, just create separate Helpers as Models. Rest of the acronyms are already fabricated.

Controllers
-----------
All Controllers reside inside a folder ''controllers''. And each controller with filename xyz and class name Controller_Xyz is routable. Public methods inside the controller can be accessed via a sanitized URL request.
Index method is the default method.

Helpers
-------
All Helpers reside inside a folder ''helpers''. A helper is loaded as simply as ''Loader::helper("some-helper")''
